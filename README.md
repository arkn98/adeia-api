## FAQ

#### Why the name?
There is an age-old convention of naming open-source projects after Greek 
mythological figures (examples: [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/),
[prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and so on). We were not able to find a
character that applies for management of leaves. So, to uphold the spirit,
we chose the transliteration `adeia` of [`άδεια`](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1),
which in Greek, means 'leave of absence'.
